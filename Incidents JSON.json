S11 HR11. The incident was observed at Segment 11 within the work area of Restoration Site S11 HR11 on 01/04/2018 at 1030 and was not in any listed species habitat. The area affected was surveyed and traversed through the restoration site. Range of feature is 10\u201312 inches wide, 3\u20136 inches deep, and 50 feet long. No workers were present during the time of the observation. Incident is presumed to be not TRTP-related and most likely caused by rain runoff. See attached photo. This incident conflicts with APM BIO-2: Minimize impacts to vegetation.", "The biologist observed inadequately installed, as well as absent, wildlife exclusionary covers over three beam pits. The incident was observed at the Kiewit receiving pit on 1/9/2018 at 1545 and was not within any listed species habitat. The area affected was surveyed and was completely within approved disturbance limits, with no further impacts visible. Two beam pits had no wildlife exclusionary devices installed and the other pit had a cover with a significant gap. No wildlife were observed in the drill pits. See attached photos. This incident conflicts with MM BR-10: Open Trenches and Pipes.", "During weed abatement activities being conducted at Site S8 R015 within the Puente Hill Land Fill property, a man working for Los Angeles County Sanitation approached me (Shawn Johnston) and asked what we were doing and who we worked for. I responded by saying we are contracted by SCE to perform habitat restoration in the area, and that we are conducting weed abatement activities. He then ask what else Edison was planning on doing here and I said \"I don't know\". He asked me who my contact was at Edison, and I said  \"Jenny McGee\". He replied \"Great I have her contact, and will call her if I have any more questions\". The man only gave me his first name \"Michael\" just before he left, and this was the extent of the conversation.", "The biologist observed a set of nest deterrents installed where nest deterrent placement was not approved (nest ID# 459). The incident was observed on Segment 1 at Magunden-Vestal #1 Construct M122-T2, on 01/15/18 at 0800 and was in Blunt-nosed Leopard Lizard modeled habitat. Three nest deterrents (inflatable balls) blocked the entrance to the formerly active GOEA nest in non-native annual grassland. No ESA signs were present for the Inactive/Vacant Raptor Nest. The nest was observed for 10 minutes.  The nest did not appear to be physically damaged or noticeably impacted by the incident. Nest event 459 has been updated to reflect the observation. The incident conflicts with APM BIO-8: Biological Monitoring", "A spill was observed under one of the transformers at the Banducci Substation. Upon closer observation, a leak coming from the transformer was identified as mineral oil spilling approximately 125 gallons. Soil, concrete foundation surrounding the transformer, and equipment were the areas immediately effected by the leak. An operator utilizing an aerial man lift accidentally struck the radiator to the transformer causing it to leak. The transformer is located immediately south of the MEER room. This incident is reported in spill report 35 and also in a property damager report to SCE.", "The biologist observed a dead Desert Cottontail. The incident was observed at the SCE transmission area at Via Campo on 1/17/2018 at 0915 and was not within any listed species habitat. The area affected was surveyed and was completely within approved disturbance limits, with no further impacts visible. The corpse was revealed when a Power Grade skip loader removed a vegetation pile. The corpse displayed no signs of trauma and was already in a state of decay. The mortality is not project related. See attached photos. This incident conflicts with MM BR-9: Construction Monitoring.", "The biologist observed a non-project O&M crew repairing conduit immediately adjacent to a restricted use area. The incident was observed near grading area 2B on 1/17/2018 at 1320 and was not within any listed species habitat. The area affected was surveyed and was completely inside approved disturbance limits, with no further impacts visible. It\u2019s known that this incident is not Mesa-related. See attached photos. This incident conflicts with MM BR-9: Construction Monitoring.", "The biologist observed 100 feet of track out from the project alignment onto Highway 150.

The operator graded approximately 100 feet of the access road within the spotted towhee buffer (UTM 281726, 3805952 to 281705, 3805973). Grading occurred as close as approximately 65 feet straight-line distance northwest of the nest. Prior to grading, at approximately 0740 the biologist observed an adult spotted towhee near the mapped location of the nest. Due to the location of the nest and density of the vegetation, the nest itself was not visible. The biologist adjusted the ESA signs based on the mapped location of the nest and H&M civil crews began road grading outside the ESA nest stakes northwest of the nest at approximately 0900. At approximately 1000, the biologist identified that the mapped location of the nest was inaccurate. Grading work was immediately halted to allow the biologist additional observation time. At 1025 the biologist located the nest and observed two small, naked nestlings in the nest and one egg on the ground outside the nest (consistent with the prior observation). The biologist immediately left the area, reestablished the ESAs in the correct location, and redirected the grading work outside the buffer.

At 9:05 am a line of vertically aligned, flat granite stones were discovered in the excavated trench at a 12 inch depth level (top of stones) to a 24 inch depth level (base of stones). The stone feature was ruled out as a continuation of a previously recorded linear feature located west of Mission Road. This was a new, non-significant find. It was recorded by Paleo Solutions archaeologist, Amanda Lloyd. Confirmation was verified to Amanda by Evelyn Chandler who consulted with Jacobs, the stones were removed and discarded into a dump truck so trenching could continue. The four stones comprised of granite material with peach and rose-colored inclusions, roughly quarried, with no chisel or scoring marks, but were all similarly sized. They were meticulously aligned in an east/west orientation paralleling Mission Road. Each stone measured approximately 15 to 18 inches wide by 12 inches high by 4 inches thick, as situated in situ. The structure of the four stones total measured 5 feet, 2 inches in length and seemed to stop with a gap at each end of that initially documented section. The stones had no concrete or mortar holding them together, just tightly compacted soil, holding the heavy stones in place end to end. Approximately 5 inches north of the stones, a heavily corroded iron nail/railroad spike was found in the disturbed topsoil only 3 inches higher in depth than the stones (8-9 inches below original ground surface). The spike was not complete and measured: 3.25 inches long, 1 inch and 5 millimeters wide at the head, and  7 millimeters wide at the broken-off tip. The head of the spike was rounded, warped, and bulbous. The spike may be associated to the stone feature, which was roughly constructed, and likely historic in age. The utilitarian purpose of the feature is yet to be determined, but upon continued excavation east, two more flat granite stones were exposed along the same configuration with a 1.5-2 foot gap in between the recorded stones, and the apparent continuation of the feature toward California Street. Since the trench excavation was moving gradually south, away from the stone line, these stones stayed safely in the wall, and were not removed, but left in place. No additional sediment disturbance went east to expose anymore potential stones in the feature. Modern disturbances in the form of urban development were numerous immediately around the feature. They included the construction of Mission Road. (within 2 feet south of the feature), the previously-installed SCE vault (within 1.5 feet west of the feature), a water utility line (subterranean location uncertain) that connected to a fire hydrant approximately 10-12 feet northeast of the feature, concrete structural foundations within 50 feet to the north of the feature, and topsoil disturbance via the use of the immediate surface area as a slight dirt shoulder on west-bound Mission Road.", "Photo documentation shows non-project related material being stored near project ROW.

Approximately 140-150 feet west of vault V5652235, 6 quarried granite slabs were exposed in an identical configuration as the stone feature that was recorded on Monday 9/10/18. The line of 6 stones measured 9 feet in length by 12-15 inches tall x 4-5 inches in thickness. The line was approximately 7-8 inches below the ground surface at the top of the stones and 19-21 inches below the ground surface at the base of the stone line. It likely continued west from this point, but was not further exposed in that immediate location. This section of this stone feature can presumably be associated to the same stone linear feature recorded Monday, but there was a 140 feet of trenching on Tuesday in between these two lines of stones, that did not expose any other section of this stone feature. Today's line of subterranean stones, was thoroughly documented and recorded by archaeological monitor, Amanda Lloyd (Paleo Solutions), and trenching activity within 100 feet of the feature was halted. The Hotline crew (Foreman is RJ Sterling) decided to pothole along their anticipated trench trajectory to see if the potentially continuing stone feature might run the length of the intended connection trench. They were also potholing for a water pipe just south of the stone feature about 3-5 feet in various locations. Four potholing locations were excavated approximately 110 feet apart moving west along the trench trajectory. The first pothole location exposed a few inches of the top of what looked like the exact same stone feature at 7-8 inches deep. 110 feet farther west from the first pothole location, the second pothole location was sterile of any granite stone slabs or any other cultural resources. 110 feet west of the second location, the third pothole location exposed one isolated granite slab with one flat side and one bulbous side, laying horizontally at a 5-6 in depth below ground surface. This stone was not connected in a configured line, and may be a previously disturbed section of the feature. The fourth and final pothole location exposed 3 more stones, 2 aligned vertically in the expected configuration, and 1 upturned horizontally, that may have been another previously disturbed section of the feature. This last pothole was approximately 40-50 feet east of underground vault V5652233.", "The biologist (Chris Taylor; EPC) observed non-project personnel cutting and trimming tree branches and vegetation while parked off of the access road on top of vegetation along the access road between 4S60 and 4N60.

Evidence of sediment washing over the perimeter controls on the west-northwestern boundary of the site. Signs of recent hydrology indicate that the surface flow channelized east of the site, bringing sediments onto the site, flowed onto the site where additional sediments were suspended, and then it overflowed the Pro-Wattle perimeter controls, carrying sediment offsite. Additionally, run-on flows were observed from the southeast corner of the site, which originated from an area of the road-side drainage along the north shoulder of San Timoteo Canyon Road. This run-on flow appears to have originated when the storm flows breached the bank of the road-side drainage, and resulted in sediment transport from the southeast corner of the site to the northwest corner of the site, where the off-site sedimentation was observed.  Evidence of sediment deposition extends approximately 20 feet from the Pro-Wattles.

The biologist confirmed that the construction activities were not project-related.", "The QSP observed the discharge and collected and analyzed the samples at 0940, 0958, and 1215 (before the maintenance crew installed an additional sediment control BMP at the discharge location). Henkels & McCoy was notified at 1030 and a BMP maintenance crew mobilized at 1100 and arrived at Construct 70 at approximately 1200 to being installing additional sediment control BMPs. The rain stopped around 1200 and there was not enough stormwater discharge to sample after the additional BMPs were installed.", "The QSP observed the discharge and collected and analysed the samples. Notifications were made and the QSP recommended additional sediment and erosion control BMPs be installed at Construct 70.", "Biologist spoke to the crew and asked them to move the vehicle to the approved work area; the biologist told the crew to drive vehicles along the approved-recommended driving path; biologist told crews they need to be WEAP trained.", "Observations were made and the lead monitor was notified.

The crew then performed a re-tailboard to develop the plan to get the conductor back in place. Barnard, SCE and Abercrombie personnel took part in the tailboard. Once the plan was developed, the crew went to work getting the conductor back into the travelers and secure for the night.\r\n\r\nSuperintendents and General Foreman will develop a pre-pull checklist that the crews will utilize when setting up for any wire pulling operation (install or removal). Before any conductor, rope or hardline is put in motion, the wire crew general foreman will perform a thorough inspection of the entire wire pull length to ensure 100% compliance with the items on the checklist. No wire will move until the General Foreman or Superintendent has signed off on the pre-pull checklist.\r\n\r\nTo complete this wreckout, Barnard and Abercrombie will change out the large travelers with a smaller diameter traveler at the 2 angle structures in this wire removal section (Shoo-fly 114 and Shoo-fly 116). A visual inspection will be performed by Foremen and General Foreman to ensure the traveler is properly installed and orientated prior to any wire movement. For future wire wreckouts, all angle structures will be evaluated to determine proper traveler size and orientation.\r\n\r\nAlthough not an issue in this incident, Barnard and Abercrombie will ensure that adequate guard structures (wood pole or mobile equipment) are installed on all public road crossings, prior to any wire movement.\r\n\r\nCrews will ensure qualified individuals are in place at each angle structure (or other critical structures \u2013 such as a potential floater).

Further inspection found sediment had migrated towards, and into a v-ditch near the south fence line. BMPs placed across the v-ditch failed to contain all of  the sediment. Additional sediment was observed on a concrete apron at the opposite end of the v-ditch, approximately 30 feet downgrade and outside of the approved work area limits.", "Site Background:\r\nStructure 4N63 and its associated temporary work area are located in a complicated area. In general, a single ephemeral riverine feature passes through the area from east to west. As is typical of drainage features in this region, the exact location of the feature changes with rain events, with the most drastic changes occurring after heavy rain events. Ephemeral \u201ctributary\u201d channels also develop during heavy rain events. Historically, supplied with water from this feature, the area probably would have been classified as a wetland and/or riparian area. Due to drought, erosion, invasive species, adjacent human development (e.g., San Timoteo Canyon Road), and other factors, the habitat degraded such that when the project was first analyzed in 2011, only portions of the area included riparian vegetation. For the past three years, however, the California Department of Water Resources and their contractors have been conducting a mitigation project with the goal of restoring the area to its natural state. As such, the area is heavily irrigated, which saturates the ground and leads to more intense channelization and sheet flow during rain events.\r\n\r\nDue to both the historic and anticipated condition of the area, a majority of the 4N63 disturbance areas were mapped as riparian and/or wetland features subject to regulation by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Regional Water Resources Control Board, and/or California Department of Fish and Wildlife. As such, the project impacts were permitted pursuant to Sections 404 and 401 of the Clean Water Act, and Section 1602 of the California Fish and Game Code (FGC). A Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) was also developed for the project. These riparian and riverine resources are also subject to a Determination of Biologically Equivalent or Superior Preservation agreement associated with SCE\u2019s participation in the Western Riverside Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan. Mitigation Measures from the Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) and Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for the project identify mitigating actions that must be undertaken to avoid and minimize impacts to water resources, and they ensure compliance with the aforementioned permits. SCE and its contractors are responsible for compliance with these project requirements.\r\n\r\nSWPPP BMPs and Inspections:\r\nPrior to the start of construction, SWPPP Best Management Practices (BMPs), including Pro-Wattle perimeter controls, were installed to prevent the offsite flow of sediment and hazardous materials. BMPs were install according to the SWPPP prepared by GeoSyntec, which accounts for average rain events. It should be noted that the perimeter controls at this location were established well inside the approved and permitted work area boundary for the purpose of minimizing impacts. Once established, inspections of SWPPP BMPs have been conducted weekly to ensure that the BMPs remain in good condition. During the January 31st site visit it was determined that additional BMPs would be needed to control stormwater flows, due to higher than anticipated hydrologic regime surrounding the project site. The BMP contractor, Power Grade, immediately responded to the need for additional BMPs, which began the morning of 1/31/2019, ahead of the forecasted rain event for 1/31/19.  On the morning of 2/1/19, Mr. Ritter conducted a post-rain follow-up inspection of the site, at which time no additional off-site flows were observed.  Furthermore, a heavier rain event was forecast for 2/2/19 thru 2/5/19, so the BMP contractor initiated on 2/1/19 the installation of additional BMPs (wire backed silt fence and gravel bag berms, and check dams) to address the potential for substantial rainfall and subsequent increased hydrology in and around the site.\r\n\r\nSite Construction Status:\r\nConstruction activities at site 4N63 have been completed. Following completion of tower construction and wire stringing, the site was graded to restore the natural contours and compacted for the purpose of stabilizing the soil. All construction equipment and materials were mobilized offsite. No potentially hazardous materials, such as oil, fuel, paint, etc., remained onsite. The next project activities would include decompaction and revegetation in accordance with the project Habitat Restoration and Revegetation Plan and Habitat Mitigation and Monitoring Plan.\r\n\r\nImpact Analysis: \r\nApproximately 3.5 cubic foot of sediment was observed outside the approved/permitted work limits. It is important to note, however, that the sediments are native sediments carried from upstream of the site and within the site. Fluvial transport is a natural function of this riverine feature, an essential ecological process. The flows did not result in any potentially hazardous materials migrating offsite. Since the feature is ephemeral, no fish or other aquatic resources potentially impacted by increases in turbidity were affected. No trees or shrubs were affected; only grasses.", "The avian, DETO, BUOW, and bat approved biologist (Hannah Buckley; Jacobs) documented the impacts. It was confirmed with West of Devers project personnel had not worked in the area recently with tracked equipment.", "The trash deposit was documented and reported to Robert Hernandez (FCR, Jacobs)."], "PERSONS_NOTIFIED": ["Ben Zamora (NOREAS)", "Mike Ireland (ICF)", "Kevin Mackay, Jenny Mcgee, and April Calhoun", "Lead Monitor, Robert Hernandez (CH2M)", "TRC Construction Manger, TRC Environmental Project Manager, Lead Monitor, SCE Site Representative", "Mike Ireland (ICF)", "Mike Ireland (ICF)", "Foreman, Sandy Tager (H&M)", "Lead Monitor, James Rasico (Rincon)", "Lead Monitors, Leslie Yen and James Rasico (Rincon)", "Shawn Johnson and Karen Weber", "Lead Monitors, Leslie Yen and James Rasico (Rincon)", "Mike Ireland (ICF)", "Mike Ireland (ICF)", "Mike Ireland (ICF) and Karen Carter (ICF)", "Mike Ireland (ICF)", "Lead Monitors, Leslie Yen and James Rasico (Rincon)", "Mike Ireland (ICF) and Karen Carter (ICF)", "Lead Monitor, Leslie Yen (Rincon)", "Environmental Compliance Supervisor, John Hindley (Rincon), Environmental Compliance Manager, Felicia Nancarrow (H&M)", "Lead Monitor, James Rasico (Rincon)", "Lead Monitor, James Rasico (Rincon)", "Lead Monitor, James Rasico (Rincon)", "Lead Monitors, Matt Schaap and Leslie Yen (Rincon)", "Leads Monitors, Matt Schaap and Leslie Yen (Rincon)", "Mike Ireland (ICF)", "Eric Willams (ICF)\r\nPete Luzich (ULM)\r\nJason Steel (Kiewit)\r\nTim Hurst (Kiewit)\r\nMike Ireland (ICF)\r\nKaren Carter (ICF)", "Mike Ireland (ICF) and Karen Carter (ICF)", "Lead Monitor, James Rasico (Rincon)", "Lead Monitor, James Rasico (Rincon)", "Lead Monitors, James Rasico and Leslie Yen (Rincon), Arborists, Stephanie Lopez and Yuling Huo (Rincon)", "Mike Ireland (ICF)\r\nPete Lubich (ULM)", "Mike Ireland and Karen Carter (ICF)\r\nPete Lubich (ULM)\r\nLori Iles-Rangel (SCE)", "Mike Ireland (ICF)\r\nPete Lubich (ULM)\r\nWillie Clark (Power Grade)", "Mike Ireland (ICF)\r\nPete Lubich (ULM)", "Mike Ireland (ICF)\r\nPete Lubich (ULM)", "Mike Ireland (ICF)", "Lead Monitor, Matt Schaap (Rincon)", "SCE (Marcus Obregon) was notified by telephone", "TRC Construcion Manager, TRC Environmental Manager, SCE Environmental Manager, SCE field rep (Brandon Ritz)", "Lead Monitor, James Rasico (Rincon)", "Lead Monitor, Matthew Schaap (Rincon)", "Karen Carter (ICF), Jenni Snibbe (ICF) and Mike Ireland (ICF)", "Lead Monitor, James Rasico (Rincon)", "Lead Monitor, James Rasico (Rincon)", "Lead Monitor, James Rasico (Rincon)", "Austin Van Meter (GANDA)\r\nJenny McGee (SCE)", "Lead Monitor, Matt Schaap (BRC)", "Lead Monitor, Matt Schaap (BRC)", "Mike Ireland (ICF), Karen Carter(ICF), Brandon Arden (SCE), and Craig Pernot (Power Grade)", "Lead monitor, James Rasico (Rincon) and Arborist, Yuling Huo (Rincon)", "Lead Monitor, Matthew Schaap (BRC)", "Lead Monitor, James Rasico (Rincon)", "Lead Monitor, James Rasico (Rincon)", "Eric Willem -

Prior to this incident, Power Grade made it a point during the morning tailboards that ANY construction activity within the 100 foot buffer to the California gnat-catcher habitat requires full-time monitoring. In an effort to make the 100 foot buffer more visible to construction personnel, Power Grade requested that flagging be installed when the area is not being monitored (SCE and ICF agreed that this would be an acceptable practice and pin-flagging the 100 foot buffer was implemented). During weekend Michels work (prior to the incident), Power Grade installed additional visible barriers (wood staking with caution tape) being that there would not be full-time monitoring of the buffer to the habitat and Michels would be working adjacent to this area. On the morning of the environmental incident, crews were reminded that construction activities were not permitted within the 100 foot buffer to the CAGN habitat without full-time monitoring and that they were not to begin work without the presence of a monitor. The Michels crew working adjacent the habitat did not understand what constitutes \"construction activities\" and commenced booming a man-lift into the buffer and walked into the habitat to attach tag lines and hoisting slings. These activities were what the biologist observed when mobilizing to the site for full-time monitoring. As a result of this incident, crews have been reminded what constitutes \"construction activities,\" and this reminder has been expressed throughout the week during the morning tailboards. Furthermore, Power Grade Environmental has had several discussions with Michels management to emphasize the project requirements and what are considered violations of those project requirements. This information was further communicated with crew leads in an effort to prevent incidents such as these from occurring in the future.

For future wire wreckouts, all angle structures will be evaluated to determine proper traveler size and orientation.\r\n\r\nAlthough not an issue in this incident, Barnard and Abercrombie will ensure that adequate guard structures (wood pole or mobile equipment) are installed on all public road crossings, prior to any wire movement.\r\n\r\nCrews will ensure qualified individuals are in place at each angle structure (or other critical structures \u2013 such as a potential floater). Spotters will ensure proper communication with both puller and tensioner/V-groove.", "BMP maintenance around v-ditch inlet began immediately on 02/08/2019. Power Grade will also blade the road, along with other high priority that were impacted by the recent severe storm conditions. 20-inch S-Fence will also be installed along the down slope perimeter of the site, and add additional gravel bag berms, and/or chevrons will be installed along the toe of the western roadside slope. The will be accomplished as soon as the material arrives onsite and the site is safe for installation.", "During the January 31st site visit it was determined that additional BMPs would be needed to control stormwater flows, due to higher than anticipated hydrologic regime surrounding the project site. The BMP contractor, Power Grade, immediately responded to the need for additional BMPs, which began the morning of 1/31/2019, ahead of the forecasted rain event for 1/31/19. On the morning of 2/1/19, Mr. Ritter conducted a post-rain follow-up inspection of the site, at which time no additional off-site flows were observed. Furthermore, a heavier rain event was forecast for 2/2/19 thru 2/5/19, so the BMP contractor initiated on 2/1/19 the installation of additional BMPs (wire backed silt fence and gravel bag berms, and check dams) to address the potential for substantial rainfall and subsequent increased hydrology in and around the site. Continued BMP maintenance activities will continue at this site, and the functionality of the current BMP layout will be evaluated and additional BMPs installed, as needed. \r\n\r\nConstruction activities at site 4N63 have been completed. Following completion of tower construction and wire stringing, the site was graded to restore the natural contours and compacted for the purpose of stabilizing the soil. All construction equipment and materials were mobilized offsite. No potentially hazardous materials, such as oil, fuel, paint, etc., remained onsite. The next project activities would include decompaction and revegetation in accordance with the project Habitat Restoration and Revegetation Plan and Habitat Mitigation and Monitoring Plan.\r\n\r\nSince the permitted feature is ephemeral, no fish or other aquatic resources potentially impacted by increases in turbidity were affected. No trees or shrubs were affected; only grasses.", "Non-project related", "Non-project related"], "GC_RESPONSE_SUBMITTED_BY": [null, "Steve Taing (Kiewit)", null, null, null, null, null, "", "", "",
